DataView Ontology defines core concepts and relations for urban data used by Nobatek/INEF4 tools for environmental and energy assessments such as lifecyle assessments of sustainable territories and decision support evaluations for the design of optimal urban heating networks. It encapsulates common vocabularies among these tools as well as vocabularies from open and public urban data sources.
